### Architecture
This section provides high-level conceptual information related to cluster deployments.

The following diagram shows the basic Dremio cluster architecture that is generally applicable to all deployments whereas:

Queries: Access can be implement via Dremio REST/UI or Dremio OJBC/JDBC drivers.
Coordinator node: One (1) or more nodes can be configured with the master-coordinator role. A single coordinator node is recommended for a Dremio cluster.
Executor nodes: One (1) or more nodes can be configured with executor role. The number of executor nodes depends on your load. For example, you would increase the number of executor nodes when you have a large queries (large amount of data or heavy computation) and/or a large number of queries.
Metadata storage: Typically locally located on the coordinator node. Default: no configuration required. If configuring for high availability, metadata storage must be configured as an external store.
Zookeeper: (not shown) Can be either embedded on the coordinator node or external. Default: embedded. If configuring for high availability, an external zookeeper quorum is required.
Distributed Store: (not shown) Mounted locally and configured on all the Dremio nodes.


### Dremio Services

This topic discusses the role of Dremio services and how they are implemented on a deployment. The Dremio services property specifies whether a node is enabled with the master coordinator, secondary coordinator, or executor role.

A Dremio cluster consists of:

One or more coordinator nodes
One or more executor nodes


- Master Coordinator Role
The master coordinator node has the special function of managing metadata. The master coordinator node is also responsible for:

Query planning
Serving Dremio’s UI
Handling client connections, including the REST API

If you are implementing High Availability, you can setup more that one coordinator node. In this case, the additional nodes are used as backup should the coordinator node fail.

- Secondary Coordinator Role
Secondary coordinator nodes improve concurrency and distribute query planning for ODBC and JDBC client requests to your deployment.

- Executor Role
Executor nodes execute queries.

- Single Node and Cluster Deployments
In single node deployments, both execution and coordination happens on the same node.
In cluster deployments, a given node may only have a single role: either a coordinator or an executor. Multiple roles per node are not supported in cluster deployments.****
